0.1:

 x laser.yaml support only
 x io only tests
 - console: display test results, scrolling

0.2:

 - html tests
 - laser.chrome
 - show error if laser not started in root directory (look for pubspec.yml and test/ directories)

0.3:

 - watch tests themselves
 - limit to specific test
 - generate all.dart test runner that calls main(), allow user to save it (for CI use)
     when test/all.dart exists, use it, otherwise generate one in /tmp

0.4:

 - multiples test files per source file

 - list files to be watched in test comment, simpler to configure, laser.yaml not required in that case
   when laser is started it will loop over all .dart/.html files in test/ looking for watch requests

   // laser:
   //   - lib/my_code.dart

 - support for default mapping, this would allow people to just list directories:

   mapping:
     - lib
     - lib/src
     - web

   default mapping: - "(\\w*?).dart": $1_test.dart

0.5:

 - 'mapping' command that lists:
     1. files mapped to existant test files
     2. files mapped to non-existant test files
     3. .dart files found in watched directories but not mapped
     4. test files without associated input/src/trigger file

 - 'mapping dir/file' shows mapping for specific files
